# CONCEPT,VARIABLE AND DATATYPE 

**## Concept of javascript**
 JavaScript is a powerful programming language that can add interactivity to a website. It was invented by Brendan Eich.
 JavaScript is versatile and beginner-friendly. With more experience, you'll be able to create games, animated 2D and 3D graphics, 
 comprehensive database-driven apps, and much more!. JavaScript itself is relatively compact, yet very flexible. Developers have written a 
 variety of tools on top of the core JavaScript language, unlocking a vast amount of functionality with minimum effort.
 ## **JavaScript Variable**
 A JavaScript variable is simply a name of storage location. There are two types of variables in JavaScript : local variable and global variable.
 There are some rules while declaring a JavaScript variable (also known as identifiers).
 Name must start with a letter (a to z or A to Z), underscore( _ ), or dollar( $ ) sign.
 After first letter we can use digits (0 to 9), for example value1.
 JavaScript variables are case sensitive, for example x and X are different variables.
 Correct JavaScript variables
 Some basic Git commands are:
```
var x = 10;  
var _value="sonoo";  
Incorrect JavaScript variables
var  123=30;  
var *aa=320;  
Example of JavaScript variable
Letâ€™s see a simple example of JavaScript variable.

<script>  
var x = 10;  
var y = 20;  
var z=x+y;  
document.write(z);  
</script>  
```
